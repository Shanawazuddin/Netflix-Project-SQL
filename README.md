- Compare Movies and TV Shows.
- Analyze content distribution by country.
- Identify common ratings and genres.
- Investigate director contributions and actor appearances.
- Highlight content trends over the years.
- Categorize content using descriptive keywords.

## üìã SQL Scripts & Analysis

### 1. **Database & Table Creation**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE NETFLIX;

USE NETFLIX;

CREATE TABLE NETFLIX (
    show_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    director VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
    cast VARCHAR(750) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    date_added VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    release_year YEAR NOT NULL,
    rating VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    duration VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    listed_in VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL
);
```

---

### 2. **Basic Queries**
- **Display All Content:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM netflix;
  ```

- **Count Movies vs TV Shows:**
  ```sql
  SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM netflix
  GROUP BY type;
  ```

---

### 3. **Insights on Ratings**
- **Most Common Ratings:**
  ```sql
  SELECT TYPE, RATING
  FROM (
      SELECT TYPE, RATING, COUNT(*) AS COUNT, 
             RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY TYPE ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS RANKING
      FROM netflix
      GROUP BY TYPE, RATING
  ) AS T1
  WHERE RANKING = 1;
  ```

---

### 4. **Country-Based Content Analysis**
- **Top 5 Countries with Most Content:**
  ```sql
  SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT show_id) AS show_count
  FROM (
      SELECT 
          TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(country, ',', n.n), ',', -1)) AS country,
          show_id
      FROM netflix
      JOIN (
          SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
      ) n ON CHAR_LENGTH(country) - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(country, ',', '')) >= n.n - 1
  ) AS countries
  GROUP BY country
  ORDER BY show_count DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

---

### 5. **Content Trends**
- **Longest Movie on Netflix:**
  ```sql
  SELECT title, duration
  FROM netflix
  WHERE type = 'Movie'
  ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED) DESC;
  ```

- **Content Added in the Last 5 Years:**
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM netflix
  WHERE date_added >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 5 YEAR;
  ```

---

### 6. **Director and Actor Insights**
- **Content by Director "Rajiv Chilaka":**
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM netflix
  WHERE FIND_IN_SET('Rajiv Chilaka', director) > 0;
  ```

- **Top 10 Actors in Indian Movies:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(cast, ',', n.n), ',', -1)) AS actor,
      COUNT(*) AS total_appearances
  FROM netflix
  JOIN (
      SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
  ) n ON CHAR_LENGTH(cast) - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(cast, ',', '')) >= n.n - 1
  WHERE country = 'India'
  GROUP BY actor
  ORDER BY total_appearances DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

### 7. **Genre Analysis**
- **Content Count by Genre:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(listed_in, ',', n.n), ',', -1)) AS genre,
      COUNT(*) AS total_content
  FROM netflix
  JOIN (
      SELECT 1 AS n UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5
  ) n ON CHAR_LENGTH(listed_in) - CHAR_LENGTH(REPLACE(listed_in, ',', '')) >= n.n - 1
  GROUP BY genre
  ORDER BY total_content DESC;
  ```

---

### 8. **Categorizing Content**
- **Content Categorization by Theme:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      category,
      COUNT(*) AS content_count
  FROM (
      SELECT 
          CASE 
              WHEN description LIKE '%kill%' OR description LIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
              ELSE 'Good'
          END AS category
      FROM netflix
  ) AS categorized_content
  GROUP BY category;
  ```
